# Open-closed Principle :

>Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) be extendable without actually changing the contents of the class you're extending. If we could follow this principle strongly enough, it is possible to then modify the behavior of our code without ever touching a piece of original code.

## Exercises

### Problem

Users want to sell the land with the specific cost. In order to sell land, users need to calculate the area.
So, we have formula: cost per unit * area.

Please look bad design at the following code. We calculate the area of Rectangle and Circle.

```php
class Rectangle
{
    public $width;
    public $height;
    public function __construct($width, $height)
    {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }
}

class Circle
{
    public $radius;
    public function __construct($radius)
    {
        $this->radius = $radius;
    }
}

class CostManager
{
    public function calculate($shape)
    {
        $costPerUnit = 1.5;
        if ($shape instanceof Rectangle) {
            $area = $shape->width * $shape->height;
        } else {
            $area = $shape->radius * $shape->radius * pi();
        }
        
        return $costPerUnit * $area;
    }
}
$circle = new Circle(5);
$rect = new Rectangle(8,5);
$obj = new CostManager();
echo $obj->calculate($circle);
```
The problem is that user want to calculate the area for Square
With the above code, We have to add Square class and modify calculate method in CostManager class. It breaks the open-closed principle.
Please look add calculate Square at the following code:
```php
class Rectangle
{
    public $width;
    public $height;
    public function __construct($width, $height)
    {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }
}

class Circle
{
    public $radius;
    public function __construct($radius)
    {
        $this->radius = $radius;
    }
}

class Square
{
    public  $a;
    public function __construct($a)
    {
        $this->a = $a;
    }
}

class CostManager
{
    public function calculate($shape)
    {
        $costPerUnit = 1.5;
        if ($shape instanceof Rectangle) {
            $area = $shape->width * $shape->height;
        } else if ($shape instanceof Circle){
            $area = $shape->radius * $shape->radius * pi();
        } else {
            $area = $shape->a * $shape->a;
        }
        
        return $costPerUnit * $area;
    }
}
$circle = new Circle(5);
$rect = new Rectangle(8,5);
$obj = new CostManager();
echo $obj->calculate($circle);
```

### Solution

1. Introduct AreaInterface to calculate area in Rectangle and Circle objects.
2. Using AreaInterface in CostManager instead of Rectangle and Circle objects.
3. Add Square class.


```php
interface AreaInterface
{
    public  function calculateArea();
}

class Rectangle implements AreaInterface
{
    public $width;
    public $height;
    public function __construct($width, $height)
    {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }
    public  function calculateArea(){
        $area = $this->height *  $this->width;
        return $area;
    }
}
  
class Circle implements  AreaInterface
{
    public  $radius;
    public function __construct($radius)
    {
        $this->radius = $radius;
    }
    public  function calculateArea(){
        $area = $this->radius * $this->radius * pi();
        return $area;
    }
}

class Square implements AreaInterface
{
    public  $a;
    public function __construct($a)
    {
        $this->a = $a;
    }
    public  function calculateArea(){
        $area = $this->a * $this->a;
        return $area;
    }
}

class CostManager
{
    public function calculate(AreaInterface $shape)
    {
        $costPerUnit = 1.5;
        $totalCost = $costPerUnit * $shape->calculateArea();
        return $totalCost;
    }
}
$circle = new Circle(5);
$obj = new CostManager();
echo $obj->calculate($circle);
```
