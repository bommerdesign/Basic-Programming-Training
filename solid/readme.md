# SOLID Principles

## Introduction

SOLID Principles is a coding standard that all developers should have a clear 
concept for developing software in a proper way to avoid a bad design. 
It was promoted by Robert C Martin and is used across the object-oriented design spectrum.
When applied properly it makes your code more extendable, logical and easier to read.

When the developer builds a software follow the bad design, the code can become 
inflexible and more brittle, small changes in the software can result in bugs. 
For these reasons, we should follow SOLID Principles.

It takes some time to understand, but if you write code following the principles 
it will improve code quality and will help to understand the most well-designed software.

To understand SOLID principles, you have to know the use of the interface clearly.
If your concept is not clear about interface then you can read this [doc](https://github.com/lappv/PAV-Training/blob/basic-programing/basicprograming/oop-interface.md).

## How To Use This Document

There are 2 parts in each lession: introduction SOLID Principles and Home work.
In introduction, I'm going to try to explain SOLID Principles in simplest way so that it's easy 
for beginners to understand. In each part of SOLID, I added exercises to explain the principle so you should read carefully.

1. SOLID Principles
- [Single Responsibility Principle](./single-responsiblity-principle/readme.md)
- [Open-closed Principle](./open-closed-principle/readme.md)
- [Liskov Substitution Principle](./liskov-substitution-principle/readme.md)
- [Interface Segregation Principle](./idependency-inversion-principle/readme.md)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](./DependencyInversionPrinciple/readme.md)

2. Home work
- [Homework 1](./exersise/exersise1.md)
- [Homework 2](./exersise/exersise2.md)

Noted: Each SOLID Principles I had the code in their folder such as.
- single-responsiblity-principle
- open-closed-principle
