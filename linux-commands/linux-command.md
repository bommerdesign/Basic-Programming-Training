xcode-select --install

# Install Homebrew
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"


# Install Graphical Apps With Homebrew Cask

# SEARCH APP NAME
brew search <app-name>
brew search java

# INSTALL APP
brew cask install <app-name>
# ex
brew cask install java

# REMOVE APP
brew remove name
ex: brew install java

```

- Or you can install manualy by bash command via instruction of the app (just some)

Similar MacOS, Ubuntu has Synaptic Package Manager like App store, you can install the application by GUI.

But you can also install the app by the command line, use `apt` (apt is package manager on Ubuntu)

```sh
# fetch the latest app information for repository
sudo apt update

# INSTALL APP
apt install <app-name>
# ex
apt install default-jre

```

> Similar, in other os systems, we have another Package Manager for that OS.
> such as Windows is [chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/packages), Centos is `Yum`, etc
